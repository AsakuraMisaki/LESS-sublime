# Less syntax for Sublime Text 3

Provides syntax highlighting for `.less` (or `.css.less`) files, with

- snippets
- completions
- symbols

Highlights code using up to date specifications for properties and values to help you catch typos.

## Installation

This package is available through [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

Alternatively you can download a release from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime) and extract it to your Packages folder.

## Contributing

LESS.tmLanguage is kept around for Sublime Text 2 support. All new improvements should be made to LESS.sublime-syntax, which is in the new YAML notation. Pull Requests to the .tmLanguage file will be considered, but we don't intend to keep them in sync.
