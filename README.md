# Less syntax for Sublime Text 3

Provides syntax highlighting for `.less` (or `.css.less`) files, with

- snippets
- completions
- symbols

Highlights code using the most up to date list of properties and values. Uses up-to-date specifications to help you catch typos.

The repo was originally forked from [danro's LESS](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LESS), but completely refactored and optimized using the new `sublime-syntax` format. We now adhere to the new [Scope Naming guidelines](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html) for optimal compatibility with color schemes and the latest beta and dev builds of Sublime Text 3. Completions are based on the [CSS package](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/tree/master/CSS).

## Installation

This package is available through [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io). Alternatively you can download a release from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/braver/LessImproved/releases) and extract it to your Packages folder.
